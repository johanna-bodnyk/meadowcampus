            <h2>Welcome to our dream home!</h2>
            <p class="lead">On August 30, 2017, The Circle School opened its doors to welcome students into a brand new 9,000 square foot building on an 8 acre campus in Harrisburg. The school's new home, which includes woods, a creek, and a gorgeous building that truly fits the school's self-directed democratic program, will give us the space to offer that program to more Central Pennsylvania families, both now and into the future. Fundraising efforts to support the 2.4 million dollar project are ongoing, and we need your help!</p>
