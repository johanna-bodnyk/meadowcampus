            <h2>We're building a new school...</h2>
            <p class="lead">In September 2016 The Circle School broke ground on a new XXX square foot building on a brand new XXX acre campus in Harrisburg. We hope to move into our new building in the fall of 2017. A sentence about how this supports increased enrollment and the long-term viability of the school or something. Fundraising efforts to support the project are ongoing, and <a href="/campaign">we need your help!</a></p>
