    <h3>Our first public airing, and a unanimous vote!</h3>

        <p style="width:402px;">The blue outlines show The Circle School's future campus; the pink portion between them was a planned road dividing the two parcels. Susquehanna Township voted last night to abandon their plans for the road.</p>

    <p>Hooray! Our request to vacate our portion of the paper street "Philadelphia Avenue" went to a public hearing last night in Susquehanna Township. The hearing lasted about five minutes, with no objections voiced. Then, about an hour later, the township commissioners (nine of them) voted unanimously to vacate. The two parcels will now abut, giving us about 7.7 contiguous acres. This was the first public airing of our project, an important milestone passed!</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, meetings with architect Rich Gribble continue, and plans for the new building's design move forward in leaps and bounds. </p>
