            <p class="lead">The Circle School needs <em>your</em> help to make a once-in-a-lifetime dream come true.</p>
            <p><img class="img-responsive pull-right" src="/images/help/rendering-2-500px.png">The dream is a campus with <strong>meadow, woods, and creek,</strong> and a building that truly fits the school's self-directed democratic program.</p>
            <p>The dream is nearly <strong>8 acres and only a mile away.</strong> The property owner will donate the land as soon as the school community raises the funds to build.</p>
            <p>Alumni are leading the charge, inviting you and all to join in, aiming for a hundred percent participation. Read on to hear the story, see the plans, and find out how <strong>everybody, even our youngest students at school, will be part of it.</strong></p>
